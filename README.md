# Learning a bit about js and apis

This repo contains the first js code I wrote, which is a very experimental API that can be used to post your insights or text and to read others's insights too (not implemented yet), with the catch that all the posts are ephemeral - because I dont know how to deal with databases and hosting one would be bothersome - and will disappear suddenly in undefined intervals.

Keep in mind that I didnt put any effort into following good coding, javascript and API development practices. Therefore, contributions and suggestions are welcome!

## How to use?

1. git clone it and run it yourself on port 3000 OR use the link (not implemented yet)
2. GET on / to receive instructions
